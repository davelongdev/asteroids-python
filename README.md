# Asteroids Game

This is an asteroids game written in python with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library.  The code makes use of object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Status

The basic functionality is finished.  I plan to extened / customize this project in the future.

## To Do

- Review code and add comments / documentation

Possibilities for extending project:

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
